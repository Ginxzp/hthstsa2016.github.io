          <h3>Mr. Robert Dennis</h3>
          <p>Robert Dennis teaches Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Civil Engineerin and Architecture at High Technology High School. He has held the position for 20 years.
            <br />
            Interview Questions:
            <br />
            ​1.Manufacturing in the U.S. is facing a critical shortage of engineers and technicians. A whole generation is retiring and there are not enough qualified young people to replace them. Contrary to headlines, the U.S. is a world leader in precision manufacturing and innovation. Today's manufacturing is complex and high tech, requiring problem-solvers with good STEM skills (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).
            <br />
            2.  Yes.  Many students return after they are in college and have been exposed to several of their engineering lab classes and say that many of the skills learned in CIM has helped them in the college courses.​
<br />
            3.  Health and Safety Engineer, Precision Machinist, Manufacturing Engineer, Quality Engineer, Robotics Engineer and Industrial Engineer.
<br />
            4.  Learn up close how things are made. Is the process for making a water bottle the same as a musical instrument? How are assembly lines designed and automated? Through your growing knowledge of the history, principles, and processes of manufacturing, you will design and build your own automated manufacturing system, factoring in safety, quality, cost, and efficiency. Use technologies in your projects that have revolutionized manufacturing: computer modeling, Computer Numeric Control (CNC) technology, Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, robotics, and flexible manufacturing systems.
