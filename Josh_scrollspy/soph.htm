        Through problems that engage and challenge, students explore a broad range of engineering topics, including mechanisms, the strength of structures and materials, and automation. Students develop skills in problem solving, research, and design while learning strategies for design process documentation, collaboration, and presentation.

        COPE is a rapid introduction to programming in Java. Students begin by learning about basic concepts such as primitive data types and eventually progress to more advanced concepts such as algorithm analysis and recursion. Emphasis is placed on constant practice with programming projects, assignments, and assessments.
